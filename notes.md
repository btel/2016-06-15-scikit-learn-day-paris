# Software Carpentry: teaching as a community effort

http://open-source-innovation-spring.org/scikit-learn-day/

Abstract:

> Since 1998, Software Carpentry has been teaching researchers in science, engineering, medicine, and related disciplines the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. We'll be talking about the teaching (what and how) and the community effort to share the work and keep the workshops going.

## Goals: 


1) SC approach to teaching (what and how) and the community effort to share the work and keep the workshops going.
2) find a few motivated persons (instructors and helpers) to continue SWC Paris
3) show how a community centered around common goals (teaching) rather than code can work (aka importing open source model to other non-computer-science areas)

## what is SC (5 min)

* show of hands: 1) Raise of hand if you have heard of Software Carpentry. 2) Raise your hand if you attended (either as a instructor, helper or student) one of SC workshops.
* international organisation whose mission is to help scientists who are programming badly to program better,
* run by volunteers
rief history
* inititated in 1998 by Greg Wilson as week-long workshops for LANL. First materials publisehd in 2004. Two day workshops introduced in 2012. The foundation was set up in 2014.
    - "It grew out of frustration he [Greg Wilson] had working with scientists who wanted to run before they could walk, i.e., to prallelize complex programs that were not broken down into self-contained functions, that did not have any automated tests and that wre not under version control"
    - "I started SC because I wanted to share solutions to problems I encountered myself and to learn from others about their problems and solution. At the beginning I tried to adapt and teach about ‘best practices’ of software engienneering like object-oriented programming and design patters (not being software engineer myself)."
    - I co-organised summer school 'Advanced Scientific Programming in Python’ in Berlin in 2009, since then it became an annual event
    - "However, I quickly realised that PhD and master students in our (computational!) lab could spend hours implementing even simple analyses like summing rows in a file"
* other common problems:
    - repeat the same analysis by hand on tens of files and save the results in spreadsheet or word document.
    - copy files and block of code as a form of 're-use' and versioning.
    - trouble to collaborate, because of lack of means to share the code.
* since their conception SC workshops went through many iterations (all documented in [4])
* recently Data Carpentry was created whose mission is to help scientists manage and analyze their data
* instructors training and certification:
    - 2-day online (with co-localised groups) or onsite 
    - focus on evidence-based teaching strategies
    - improve the sense of community
* SC publications (lessons, peer-reviewed papers and evaluation reports)
* SC community worldwide
    - screenshots of “Our team” and “Past workshops” maps from the websites.
    - number of workshops, instructors and countries, where  workshops were held
* SC partners

## Typical workshop (3 min):
(I plan to show the webpage and explain a bit about the schedule, installation etc. However to keep it quick, I may just emphasise diferences from standard programming training classes)

* self-organised vs SCF-organised workshops:
    - SC takes care of finding certified instructors, handles registration, facilitates communication with hosts
    - extra fees for SC-organised workshops
    - for self-organised at least one instructor must be certified to get the branding 
    - custom workshops not endorsed by SC but following their method and some of the lesson content
    - added value of SC branding: you gain visibility and become part of global community
* show a sample webpage [Proto204](https://paris-swc.github.io/2016-05-24-proto204/)
* most commonly two-day workshops - they are easier to organise, involve less committment from participants, are not very tiring, can reach larger audience
* one instructor per lesson, one helper per 8 students
* registration: typically 40 students, often first-come first-served
* code of conduct (set up a supportive learning environment, promote diversity, require professional behaviour etc.)
* pre-workshop survey
* software setup:
    - students' own laptops,
    - three platforms supported (Linux, MacOS, Windows)
    - anaconda for Python, Git for Windows (including bash)
* core topics (lessons)
    - a programming language (Python/R/Matlab), unix shell (bash) and version control (git)
    - teach basics for beginners - pareto law - 30% of efforts to reach 70% of scientific computing skills
* etherpad for collaborative notetaking (show [etherpad](http://etherpad.software-carpentry.org/proto204) of Proto204 school)
* live coding!:
    - writing code and explaining it at the same time is more convincing than showing code on slides
    - instructors more flexible and responsive to questions from audience
    - students learn from instructors’ mistakes
    - it slows instructors down
* post-its (bring and show some)
* obtain feedback by post-its, etherpad and surveys
* show photos


## SC as an open source community - similarities / differences (3 min):
(Related to Goal 3. To keep it short I will put the main characteristic of OSS communities on a slide and just explain how they relate to SC)

* what characterises OSS community like scikit-learn: 
    - [Common Characteristics of an Open Source Community](https://blogs.s-osg.org/common-characteristics-of-an-open-source-community/) by Ben Lyold Pearson
    - generally inclusive by default, and are exclusively transparent
    - distributed contributors - mainly volunteers but also employed in companies
    - differing motivations (commercial, academic and "philantropic")
    - working together on a open source "product" (software)
    - communicatig through internet channels (mailing lists, issue trackers, chats etc.)
    - Self-Organizing Meritocracy: 
      > Reputation in an open source community is gained by making valuable contributions to the project, and leadership in these communities must be earned through experience. 
    - scalable hierarchy
      > As the project grows, it is common for it to be divided into subsystems and for the releases to become more organized and standardized. 
    
* SC Similarties:
    - memebers of SC community share goals (make the world a better place) and interests (computation and teaching)
    - centered around collaboratively edited, reusable content - our lessons:
        + CreativeCommons-licensed - can be re-used for non-SC workshops
        + lesson templates for new lessons
        + example — Python lesson: 89 contributors, ~1000 commits, 120 PRs merged, 200 forks, 4000 lines of lesson content
        + instructors are encouraged to adapt the materials for their needs and contribute back their changes
    - communication: blog, mailing lists, Github issue tracker, videoconferences, in-person meetings
    - hierachical (local SC community, global community, advisory boards etc.)

* SC Differences:
    - teaching as enacted skill and as such it requires physical presence (video recordings are tested):
        > To make a musical analogy, the lesson plan, slides, and assignments are only the score; what matters most is how it's performed
      

## Locally (4 min)
(Camille is working on some graphs from previous workshops. I would like to add some "testimonials" from the feedback channels. Send me anything you liked in particular in what the participants said/wrote).

* who are we? (introduce Paris-based instructors and helpers)
    - with photos (from Our team page [1]), insitution logos
    - 6 instructors recently certified, 3 instructors active since SC conception (2012?)

* what has been already achieved? 
    - workshops sites (7 SC and SC-based workshops, including pre-2015 workshop and instructor training) - 
    - advanced workshop at Telecom
    - all of our workshops filled within few hours after opening of registration
        + stats on number of applications for Telecom and Gif?
    - Bug BBQ this week with numerous contributions to the core lessons
    - two new SC-style lessons created (and waiting for contributors)
        
* to show on slides:
    - Paris map with institutions with hosts logos?
    - photos
    - infographics with stats (number of participants, gender distribution, field distribution, stage of career, how many said that the workshop was useful and would recommend it to friends?)
    - sample feedback, results of surveys, testimonials
        + “I had the chance to work with some of the participants after the workshop. Although, I do see that their knowledge and confidence with bash, git or python improved, after the course they would go back to their original habits of running their analysis manually and keeping versions of their files in directories (or commenting un-used/experimental code). There is still much work to do to enhance the retention of the information and putting it in practice”

* how to join us? how to organise a workshop? 
    - two ways: contact us or Software Carpentry
    - ask me about our conditions:
        + find location for about 20-40 students (some recipes for good location are available at Software Carpentry website [1])
        + organise coffee breaks and lunch for students and instructors (including funding for coffee; if there are good lunch options around, lunch funding for students is optional)
        + handle the registrations (at least half of the places should be open to public).

* what is next?
    - workshop at your institute,
    - possibly other French cities,
    - workshops in French?
    - ASPP (aka G-node) school in Reading, UK
    - insitutional support - can we find an insitute interested in becoming a SCF partner [3] (it means extra charges, but we can also train more instructors)

* acknowledge supporting institutions (hosts, sponsors, instructors’ affiliations, funding agencies)
